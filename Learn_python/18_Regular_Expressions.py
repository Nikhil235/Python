# Regular Expressions (RegEx) in python using the built in re module
# Use them to search for text patterns within text editors
# they basically allow us to search for and match specific patterns of text
# Raw string -> prefixing a string ( r or R )
# Raw string is useful when a string needs to contain a backslash,
# such as for a regular expression or Windows directory path,
# you dont want it to be treated as an escape character.
